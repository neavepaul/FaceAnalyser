# FaceAnalyser
Simple face analyser using face-api.js 

Application developed in js to recognize users and detect emotions in the faces of humans.
The application does not save user images. User images are used only to extract features. After that a json file is maintained which is loaded at the time of execution.

*This app is purely functional. Aesthetics were not taken into account
